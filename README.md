My initial mockups were a little messy:

But the finished product is more polished:

#### This project was created using JavaScript and JQuery

#### In version 2, I plan to add a "hint" feature in easy mode only that allows the player to reveal a category or theme of the secret word. I would also like to fix the score board so it makes more sense in two player mode.
