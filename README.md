# Hangman Game

### This is the first project I completed for my Web Development Immersive class at General Assembly

#### Hangman is played by guessing letters you think are within the secret word. Reveal the whole word before your remaining incorrect guesses reaches zero.

My initial mockups were a little messy:

But the finished product is more polished:

#### This project was created using JavaScript and JQuery

#### In version 2, I plan to use a different method to collect the user's secret word, instead of a prompt box, and figure out how to hide the typed content so the user's opponent cannot see what is typed. I would also like to fix the score board so it makes more sense in two player mode.
